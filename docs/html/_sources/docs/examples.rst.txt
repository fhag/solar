Full solar
----------

.. figure:: ../pics/inenvelope.png
    :scale: 70 %
    :align: left

    Graph data is taken at 15 minutes intervalls. Car charging ist from 12.15
    to 13.00.

Legend:

   :Produktion: chart showing solar power production

   :Direktverbrauch: power directly consumed

   :Batterie (Laden): power used to charge battery (<= 3kW)

   :Netzeinspeisung: power to grid

   :S Produktion: total solar power production

   :Prognose: forecast of solar power production based on weather forecasts

Mixed charging
--------------

.. figure:: ../pics/overenvelope.png
    :scale: 70 %

    Mixed charging with grid and solar power (from 15.30 to 17.30) reduces
    costs even if the more expensive grid power is used.

The maximum grid power to use for car charging is
defined in "cardefaults.json".

Additional legend:

   :Hausverbrauch: power consumption of all house consumers

   :Batterie (Entladen): power provided by battery discharging (<= 3kW)

   :Netzbezug: power from grid

End of day
----------

.. figure:: ../pics/endofday.png
    :scale: 70 %
    :align: left

    When solar power is declining at end of day charging is maintained until the
    grid power exceeds the defined threshold (~16.15 to 19.30).

Same legend as above.
