.. Introduction of Solar explaining backgrund and
   working principles of the application

Introduction
==============

The purpose of this application is to maximise electric car (EV) charging with local solar power.
The application monitors the power fed into the grid, and switches car charging on, if the car is at home, needs charging and
enough power is collected from the solar panel.
Normally the car charging is set to 60% or 70%, and charged overnight, if necessary.
During the day the car is charged up to 90% (or higher if set higher) if solar power is available.

The application runs on a Raspberry Pi which is connected to the local network and has internet access (through the router).
The Main application monitors the state of the PV system and power fed to the grid.
If all conditions are met car charging is started if car conditions are met (at home, plugged in, needs charging and connection established).

The application avoids excessive on/off switching and car polling.

Solar installation
++++++++++++++++++

94 solar panels on the roof with 27.7 kWp power are installed. Two inverters
("PV Wechselrichter" and "ext. Quelle") feed the E3DC S10 system.
Depending on power consumption ("Hausverbrauch") and production
main consumers are switched on or off by the E3DC system.

Consumers which can be switched on/off are:

- hot water boiler for 200l  (2000W)

- hot water boiler for 300l  (3000W)

- heat pump overheating buffer tank with 300l (4000W) (SG Ready Standard)

- battery of E3DC S10 with 19.8kWh (+/- 3000W)  ("Batterie")

All consumers draw power only if the target temperatures or state of charge are not yet met.
Excessive power is delivered/taken to/from the grid ("Netz") .

A Tesla car draws 11kW when charging through the wall charger.

"Solar fuel" costs
++++++++++++++++++

Maximising self-sufficiency is including car charging reduces load to the grid and minimes power costs.
As each installation will have different prices and costs all trigger parameters must be adapted to the specific installation.
In this installation the costs are as follows$.

-   Power from the grid costs ~ CHF 0.15 - 0.19 (depending on day time and weekday)

-   Power fed into the grid yields return of CHF 0.038 after income taxes.

Hence charging for 100km (200W/km) costs approximately between CHF 3.00 to 3.80 with
grid power. The opportunity costs for 100km with 100% solar power are CHF 0.76 in comparison.

Charging parameters
+++++++++++++++++++

Obviously the "optimal" charging depends on costs, main consumers, charging
power, driving and consumption habits, technical system, power production and
other factors. The parameters for switch power on and off are therefore
estimated and can be adjusted. They are defined in "newdefaults.json".

   :linenos:


.. option:: seconds_btw_updates

   Seconds between car updates (activation of car API)

.. option:: fname_charging_status

    Path and filename for saving charging_flag status e.g. "solar/data/charging_flag.csv"

.. option:: soc_minimum

    Minimum state of charge of house battery before allowing car charging. When car charging
    is switched on depending on day time or cloud coverage the solar power production is not sufficient.
    The house battery reduces the gap and thus minimes grid consumption.

.. option:: evsoclimit_low

   Up to this lower charging limit the following trigger levels are valid

.. option:: evstart_power_low

   Start charging when power to grid (negative) exceeds this limit

.. option:: evstop_power_low

   Stop charging when power from grid (positive) exceeds this limit

.. option:: evsoclimit_high

   Up to this higher charging limit the following trigger levels are valid

.. option:: evstart_power_high

   Start charging when power to grid (negative) exceeds this limit

.. option:: evstop_power_high

   Stop charging when power from grid (positive) exceeds this limit
